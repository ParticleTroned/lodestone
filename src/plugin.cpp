// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Lodestone - Shared SKSE framework
//
// Phase 16 - Stage A: validation plugin (load log).
// Phase 16 - Stage B: lean entry point. plugin.cpp implements nothing itself -
//   it only orchestrates the load:
//     1. Bring up the log        -> Log.cpp
//     2. Initialize SKSE         -> required before requesting any interface
//     3. Register Papyrus natives -> Papyrus.cpp (dispatcher)
//
//   No IM functionality goes here - that's Stage C. Every new module plugs
//   into the dispatcher (Papyrus.cpp), NOT into this file.
//
// Phase 16 - Stage C.1: a fourth step appears -
//     4. Register a message listener -> installs engine hooks on kDataLoaded
//
//   This is the one exception to "everything plugs into the dispatcher". The
//   dispatcher is for PAPYRUS NATIVES. Engine hooks are not natives: they have
//   no Papyrus surface and a different lifecycle (the vtable must exist, but
//   the VM need not be up). So hook installation gets its own seam here.
//
//   Phase L0 update: CastTime now uses BOTH seams. It is an engine hook (installed
//   here on kDataLoaded) AND a native provider (RegisterCastTimeChannel, plugged
//   into the dispatcher like any other module). The two are independent: the hook
//   is passthrough until a consumer calls the native to register its channel.
//   C.2 (book text) and C.3 (spell tomes) also expose natives and plug into the
//   dispatcher as Stage B predicted.
//
//   kDataLoaded is the install point for the hook: a vtable swap alone would work
//   earlier, but the vtable must exist, and kDataLoaded is the established, safe
//   seam. The module no longer caches any globals here - they arrive at runtime
//   through the native.
//
// Phase L3 update: four modules now install hooks here, by two mechanisms:
//     CastTime, MagicScaling  -> vtable swap (virtual targets)
//     BookFramework, SpellTomes -> SafetyHook inline hook (non-virtual targets)
//
//   The split is not a preference, it is what the target allows. CommonLibSSE's
//   Trampoline::write_branch is used by none of them: it redirects an existing
//   rel32 call site and cannot detour a function body, which is a distinction
//   that cost a crash and two silently dead modules to learn. See the rule
//   recorded in CMakeLists.
