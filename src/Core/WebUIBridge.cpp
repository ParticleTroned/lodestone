			// through the main-thread task queue - see DispatchToGame. A native
			// cannot wait for a queued answer without blocking the VM thread on
			// the game thread, which is a deadlock waiting for a bad day. The
			// mirror is exact for every transition this module made, and this
			// module is the only thing that can move a view it created.
			//
			// IT STARTS HIDDEN, AND IT DEFAULTED TO VISIBLE UNTIL 1.23.1. That
			// default was a straight lie for the window between CreateView and
			// the consumer's first Show: the backend hides a view at creation -
			// MeridianUIBackend calls SetBrowserVisible(false) and says so in the
			// log - while this field claimed it was on screen. So
			// WebUIIsViewVisible answered True and WebUIGetViewState answered 2,
			// "ready and visible", for a panel nobody had shown yet.
			//
			// The symptom a consumer saw was the other end of it: state 1,
			// "ready, hidden", was unreachable. A script waiting for 1 before
			// calling Show waited forever, because the view went from 0 straight
			// to 2.
			//
			// Nobody wrote a wrong transition; the initial value was wrong and
			// every transition after it was right, which is why Show and Hide
			// always behaved and only the first window lied.
			//
			// MEASURED ON ONE BACKEND, CONTRACTUAL ON THE OTHER, and the
			// difference is worth knowing before someone "corrects" this back.
			// Meridian is measured: it hides at creation and logs that it did.
			// PrismaUIBackend::CreateView hides nothing, and whether Prisma
			// shows a view the moment it exists was never measured here. True is
			// what Lodestone.psc promises for both - "a view becomes visible when
			// WebUIShow is called, not when it is built" - so if Prisma turns out
			// to create a visible view, the defect is that divergence, not this
			// field, and it gets fixed in the backend that has it.

			// behave that way: a backend that arbitrates can hand it to somebody
			// else, the player can take it back with the backend's own panic
			// chord, and a view can be destroyed while holding it. None of those
			// pass through here.
			//
			// So this is written from WebUIBackendCallbacks::FocusChanged, which
			// a backend sends when it OBSERVES a change rather than when one is
			// requested. The cost is that it lags reality by one poll interval;
