// BookFramework.h
// Lodestone - Shared SKSE framework
//
// Module: BookFramework (Core)
// Owns the dynamic book-text capability (Stage C.2): a consumer can supply
// runtime-built text for a book (a journal that grows as the player plays, notes
// assembled at runtime, and so on), and the plugin shows that text when the book
// is opened.
//
// CORE, agnostic: the module knows no consumer by name. The consumer identifies a
// book by its own Book form and hands the plugin the text; the plugin keys the
// text by that book's FormID and serves it at display time.
//
// PUBLIC API (declared in Lodestone.psc, registered on the "Lodestone" script):
//
//   Bool   Function SetBookText(Book akBook, String asText) global native
//   Bool   Function AppendBookText(Book akBook, String asText) global native
//   Bool   Function ClearBookText(Book akBook) global native
//   String Function GetBookText(Book akBook) global native
//
//   Book maps to RE::TESObjectBOOK* (a form pointer parameter, verified the same
//   way CastTime's GlobalVariable was: RE/P/PackUnpack.h registers a form pointer
//   under its FORMTYPE and unpacks it back to the same pointer type). SetBookText
//   replaces the stored text, AppendBookText adds to it, ClearBookText drops it
//   (the book reverts to its record text), GetBookText reads it back.
//
// HOW IT WORKS (the design question the Part 1.5 trace was built to settle):
//   A book's page text reaches the engine's Book Menu as a RAW BSString argument
//   to the game's book-open function (RE/B/BookMenu.h). The record's own text is a
//   localized-string id that cannot hold arbitrary runtime text, so dynamic text
//   must be injected on the DISPLAY path, not written into the record. This module
//   therefore hooks the game's book-open function: when a book with stored text is
//   opened, it substitutes the stored string for the argument and calls the
//   original; when a book has no stored text, it passes through untouched (vanilla
//   text). That passthrough is the same silent-degradation property CastTime has:
//   "no text set" is indistinguishable from "plugin not installed".
//
//   HOOK TARGET (VALIDATED IN GAME): the function CommonLibSSE-NG names
//   BookMenu::OpenMenu_Impl, RELOCATION_ID(50122, 51053). The ID is not in the
//   shipped headers - it was taken from the CommonLibSSE-NG source. SE/AE use
//   eight arguments; VR adds a ninth NiAVObject* that must be forwarded unchanged
//   because the engine retains it and releases it when the menu closes.
//
//   Do NOT go looking for BookMenu::OpenBookMenu. It is declared in
//   RE/B/BookMenu.h but has no implementation anywhere in the vendored
//   CommonLibSSE-NG - BookMenu.cpp implements OpenMenuFromReference,
//   OpenMenuFromBaseForm and OpenMenu_Impl, and not it. It is a dead symbol, and
//   starting from the header name leads to a function that does not exist.
//
// PERSISTENCE (v1): the stored text lives in memory for the session only - it is
//   NOT serialized into the save. A consumer re-establishes a book's text after
//   each load (SetBookText from its own Papyrus state), the same runtime-registration
//   model CastTime uses. Co-save serialization is a documented FUTURE improvement,
//   deliberately not built here.
//
// ORDERING: SetBookText must land before the book is opened for the new text to
//   show. A consumer sets it at load/init or whenever the underlying data changes.
//
// This module has TWO seams, like CastTime: RegisterFuncs(vm) plugs its natives
// into the Papyrus dispatcher (Core/Papyrus.cpp), and Install() installs the engine
// hook from plugin.cpp on kDataLoaded.
//
// Phase L1 - Stage C.2
