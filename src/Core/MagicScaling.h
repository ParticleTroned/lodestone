// MagicScaling.h
// Lodestone - Shared SKSE framework
//
// Runtime scaling of a spell's magnitude, duration and magicka cost.
//
// THE CAPABILITY. A consumer owns three pairs of GlobalVariable records and
// drives them from its own Papyrus state - typically from some attribute it
// tracks. It registers each pair through the natives below, and from then on
// this module applies that pair to the matching quantity at the point where the
// engine has finished computing it. Nothing here decides balance: the DLL
// applies numbers the consumer supplies, which is the same division of labour
// the cast time module follows.
//
// PASSIVE UNTIL ASKED. Every channel is independent and every one is
// passthrough until someone registers it. Install this plugin with no consumer
// present and magnitude, duration and cost are exactly what they would have
// been - the hooks are installed, but they do nothing beyond a pointer compare.
// A consumer that registers only the cost channel gets only cost scaled.
//
// WHERE IT APPLIES (all three located by measurement - see the Part 1.5 trace in
// git history, and the notes in the .cpp):
//
//   magnitude  Actor::ForEachPerkEntry        vfunc 0x100, vtable swap
//   duration   ActiveEffect::AdjustForPerks   vfunc 0x00, vtable swap
//   cost       MagicItem::CalculateCost       inline hook (non-virtual)
//
// Duration and cost scale a value the engine has already finished computing, so
// they are additive to it rather than competing with it. Magnitude is different
// and the difference is the point: it is contributed as a perk entry rather than
// written after the fact, because a perk entry is a thing the SPELL MENU also
// asks about. Scaling magnitude at AdjustForPerks worked on the damage and was
// invisible in the tooltip, since an active effect is instantiated on a target
// and the menu never instantiates one. Cost was only ever visible there by luck
// - CalculateCost happens to be a function the menu calls, and there is no
// CalculateMagnitude to match it.
//
// A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT SEAM, worth knowing before tuning balance: magnitude now
// COMPOSES with real perks the way another perk would, instead of applying after
// the engine has finished with them. For a character carrying damage perks the
// final number differs from what the old seam produced.
//
// DURATION DOES NOT DISPLAY. Its column in the spell menu is wrong for exactly
// the reason magnitude's was. Moving it to the same seam is additive and is not
// done yet.
//
// SCOPE - ORDINARY SPELLS WITH A SCHOOL. A spell is in scope when its type is
// Spell AND its costliest effect has a magic school (associated skill is not
// None). Not abilities, not enchantments, not powers, not food, not potions. A
// consumer asking to scale "spell magnitude" does not mean those, and the trace
// that found these seams caught armour enchantments at magnitude 25 and a quest
// ability at 300 coming through the same path.
//
// NARROWED IN 1.28.0. Through 1.27.x the test was the spell type alone, and a
// Spell-type record with no school was scaled like a Firebolt. Those are mod
// machinery rather than magic - a buff, a marker or a cooldown timer another mod
// casts from Papyrus with the player as the source - and scaling them stretched
// timers that were never the player's magic: Strength Matters' 60 second
// Workout lasted about 103 seconds under a high attribute. The price, accepted
// by decision: a script-cast sub-spell or proc with no school of its own stops
// scaling, while the spell that casts it still scales.
//
// Why the COSTLIEST effect: it is where the magic menu takes a spell's school
// from, and the one school the player ever sees for it. SpellRead reads school
// through the same effect (measured 123 of 123 against SKSE in L-F3). One test,
// on the spell, for all three channels - so a two-effect spell never has its
// cost scaled while half its duration is not.
//
// The channels enforce this in different places, because they sit in different
// seams. Duration tests the effect's source spell at AdjustForPerks, and cost
// tests the spell at CalculateCost. Magnitude cannot - ForEachPerkEntry is
// handed an entry point and a visitor, with no spell in sight - so the test
// moved into CheckConditionFilters, which does receive the entry point's
// arguments and therefore the spell. Anything unreadable there answers "does
// not apply". A spell with no effects, or whose costliest effect has no base
// effect, is out of scope too.
//
// Narrow is the recoverable direction: widening later is additive, whereas
// shipping wide would silently rescale every enchantment in the load order and
// there would be no way to take that back from saves already played. That is not
// a hypothetical - it is a defect this module was measured against and fixed.
//
// FORMULA, per channel: value = (value * multiplier) + offset. A channel whose
// multiplier is 1 and offset 0 is a no-op, so a consumer can neutralise one
// channel without unregistering it. Negative results are clamped to zero.
//
// ONLY WHAT ALREADY EXISTS IS SCALED. An effect with no magnitude keeps none -
// the offset is not applied to a zero, because that would invent magnitude on
// effects that never had any (every script effect and controller ability in the
// load order). Same for duration. This mirrors the cast time module, which
// refuses to invent charge time on a spell whose record has none.
//
// PLAYER ONLY, like the cast time module - by decision, not by limitation. Both
// hooks receive the casting actor, the formula is evaluated per call rather than
// cached, and Channel is a plain struct a second instance can be made of. So the
// player test is one branch in each thunk, and nothing here has to be rebuilt to
// serve NPCs.
//
// RESERVED SEAM - NPC SCALING, and the trap in it. Relaxing the player test is
// NOT how NPC support gets built. A channel is a pair of GlobalVariable records,
// and a global holds ONE value: that works for the player because there is one
// player. Dropping the test would apply the player's own multiplier to every NPC
// in the cell, which is worse than not supporting them at all.
//
// NPC scaling needs a per-actor source instead, and there are at least three
// shapes it could take:
//   - one global shared by all NPCs (trivial, but every mage scales alike,
//     regardless of skill or level)
//   - an actor value the consumer writes per NPC and this module reads in the
//     hook (per actor, and a cheap read on a hot path)
//   - a Papyrus callback per cast (most flexible, and the one to avoid - calling
//     into the VM from a hook this frequent is expensive and fragile)
//
// Which one is right depends on a design decision that has not been made: what
// an NPC's scaling should derive from. That is why no NPC API is published here
// yet. The Papyrus API only ever grows - a published signature can never be
// changed - so guessing the shape now would be carried forever, while the
// internal cost of adding it later does not grow with time. Deferring is the
// cheap direction on both axes.
//
// The cast time module carries a similar note; its wording assumes the
// derivation is the actor's school skill, which is one of the options above
// rather than a settled decision.
//
// MULTI-CONTRIBUTOR PER QUANTITY SINCE 1.9.0, matching the cast time module.
// Every distinct plugin that registers contributes: multipliers compose by
// product, offsets by sum, applied in one pass. Re-registering the same pair is
// an idempotent refresh (a consumer may re-register on every load). Through
// 1.8.2 each quantity was a single channel, first-registrant-wins, and a
// different second registrant was warned and rejected - see MultiChannel.h for
// why that was retired and why a lone consumer computes the same numbers either
// way.
//
// PERSISTENCE. Registration is session-scoped and not serialised. A consumer
// re-registers after each load, exactly as it does for the other modules.
//
// Version gate for consumers: Lodestone.GetVersion() >= 1004000 (1.4.0).
//
// Phase L3 (Part 2)
