// WebUIBackend.h
// Lodestone - Shared SKSE framework
//
// The seam between the WebUI bridge and whichever web UI framework is actually
// installed. See WebUIBridge.h for what the bridge is and why it exists.
//
// WHY THIS SEAM EXISTS AT ALL. The 1.18.0 rename argued that "swapping one
// pointer for a vector of adapters later is invisible to every consumer". That
// was a promise, and this file is the first half of testing it: the bridge is
// split here without adding a single behavior, so that if the promise was wrong
// it fails now, with one backend and one consumer, instead of later with four.
//
// WHAT BELONGS ON WHICH SIDE OF IT. The split is not "engine vs logic" - it is
// "does the answer change when the installed framework changes".
//
//   Backend      the vendor's API, its handle type, its callback shapes, its
//                view root, its name, and what it can and cannot do.
//   Coordinator  the view table keyed by the consumer's own string id, the
//                listener slot pool, the mod events, the main-thread dispatch,
//                the single-holder focus policy, and all 25 natives. None of
//                that changes with the vendor.
//
// Test, when it is not obvious: if the code would read identically for a
// framework nobody has written yet, it is the coordinator's.
//
// THE OPERATIONS ARE CALLED ON THE MAIN GAME THREAD, ALWAYS. The coordinator
// owns that decision and every one of them arrives through its task queue - see
// DispatchToGame in WebUIBridge.cpp for why that is not optional for a native
// running on the Papyrus VM thread. A backend never has to queue anything of its
// own, and must not assume it may block.
//
// REPORTING BACK RUNS THE OTHER WAY AND ON ANY THREAD. A backend calls the
// three functions in WebUIBackendCallbacks below from whatever thread its
// framework hands it, which is generally not the game thread. Those three are
// the only entry points a backend has into the coordinator.

		// at all. See HasCapability in each backend for the trap this pair of
