// MeridianUIBackend.cpp
// Lodestone - Shared SKSE framework
//
// The Meridian UI half of the WebUI bridge. See WebUIBackend.h for the seam and
// WebUIBridge.h for what the bridge is.
//
// Meridian UI is an independently maintained fork of NirnLabUIPlatform, backed
// by CEF rather than Ultralight. Its API headers are vendored in
// extern/meridianui-api/ under their own MIT license - unlike Prisma's, which
// cannot be tracked here. See the README in that folder.
//
// NEITHER BACKEND IS A DEPENDENCY. Meridian is detected at runtime and its
// absence is the ordinary case, exactly like Prisma's.
//
// THREE THINGS DIFFER FROM PRISMA, AND THEY ARE WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR:
//
//   1. Acquisition is a two-step SKSE handshake, not a request. The pointer
//      does not exist until kInputLoaded. See Probe() and HandleSKSEMessage().
//   2. There is NO page-ready callback anywhere in the API - only the
//      IsPageLoaded() poll. So this file watches, on the game thread, and
//      reports readiness itself. See the watcher below.
//   3. JS bindings live under an object, not on the bare window, and calls into
//      the page go through ExecuteJavaScript rather than a dedicated entry
//      point. Both are papered over so a page written for one backend works on
//      the other. See kJsObjectName and Call().
