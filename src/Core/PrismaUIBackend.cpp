		// panel focused and a word typed into its text field, a sink on
		// BSInputDeviceManager received every key, and saw Ctrl+Backspace
		// complete with HasAnyActiveFocus() true. The probe is parked in the
		// private work area, not in this repository.
		//
		// IT ONLY RELEASES. IT NEVER TOGGLES. Meridian's chord is a toggle and is
		// safe there only because it is armed on the browser holding focus. This
		// sink sees every key in the game; a toggle would hand focus to a view
		// that did not have it, which is the stranded state the chord exists to
		// undo. For the player the effect is the same on both backends: the chord

		//
		// WHAT IT RELEASES: the views of THIS bridge that hold focus, and nothing

		// this plugin's to take input from, and the same E1 showed why the test
		// cannot be HasAnyActiveFocus(): it was already true with only a

			// --- Focus -------------------------------------------------------
			//
			// HISTORY FIRST, BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS THE CODE BELOW. From 1.22.0 to
			// 1.26.x this backend answered false to "view-focus" and these two
			// were stubs that logged an error if reached. The comment that
			// justified it is kept as it was written, between the two rules
			// below, and it is still right about facts 1 and 2. Fact 3 stopped
			// being true in 1.27.0 (2026-09-17, phase L-U7): Lodestone now has
			// an input sink, measured in game to see the chord with a Prisma
			// panel focused - see the panic chord section above.
			//
			// ------------------------------------------------------------------
			// WHY THE CAPABILITY IS false, AND IT IS NOT THAT THE API IS
			// MISSING. PrismaUI_API.h has Focus, Unfocus, HasFocus and
			// HasAnyActiveFocus, all of them per view, and calling them would
			// compile and would do something. Three measured facts say not to:
			//
			//   1. Focus is not a local operation here. The framework routes
			//      input for the whole PROCESS, not per view: one elected view
			//      id, one capture flag, one "a text field has focus" flag.
			//      Focusing one view takes the keyboard from every other Prisma
			//      consumer in the game, including ones that never heard of
			//      Lodestone.
			//   2. Unfocus closes the framework's single kModal focus menu for
			//      every view at once, so a second view on screen is left with a
			//      stranded cursor. A sibling project of this tree exhausted the
			//      four-way flag matrix in game - both pauseGame and
			//      disableFocusMenu, all combinations - and found no mitigation.
			//      The two public flags do not touch the broken path.
			//   3. There is no panic key to escape with. The other backend
			//      publishes an unswallowable chord of its own
			//      (ToggleBrowserFocusByKeys, IBrowser.h); this API has no
			//      equivalent, and Lodestone installs no input sink anywhere, so
			//      a stranded cursor here would leave killing the process as the
			//      only way out.
			//
			// Answering false costs a consumer an interactive panel on this
			// backend and costs it nothing else: it asks, it gets an honest no,
			// and it degrades. Answering true would trade that for a failure
			// mode the player pays for and cannot escape.
			//
			// THIS IS A DECISION, NOT A CEILING. It reverses the day somebody
			// measures the deferred-unfocus path in game and can say what
			// HasAnyActiveFocus() actually reports while an unfocus is still
			// queued. Growing false into true is invisible to every consumer
			// that already asks first, which is why the capability shipped
			// before the feature.
			// ------------------------------------------------------------------
			//
			// WHAT 1.27.0 DOES WITH FACTS 1 AND 2: says them to the consumer
			// instead of deciding for it. Focusing a view here takes the keyboard
			// from every Prisma panel in the game, including mods that never
			// heard of Lodestone, and an unfocus closes the focus menu for all of
			// them. Lodestone.psc states both where a consumer reads
			// "view-focus".
			//
			// THE ASYNCHRONY, measured by a sibling project of this tree and
			// relied on below: Focus and Unfocus take effect a task-queue turn
			// later, and HasFocus read in the same frame answers from before the
			// command. Focus returns early without reinstalling keyboard capture
			// when HasFocus already answers true, even stale. And Focus on a
			// document that has not loaded silently loses the framework's
			// focus-tracking script - which the coordinator already rules out, by
			// dispatching only for a view whose DOM-ready has fired.
			//
			// THE DEFERRED UNFOCUS, MEASURED HERE, which is the question the
			// comment above said the false was waiting on. Phase L-U7, E4, in
			// game on 2026-09-17, Prisma UI 1.5.0, with a temporary probe around
			// every Unfocus this file sends: six calls, four from ClearFocus and
			// two from the panic chord. In ALL SIX, HasFocus and
			// HasAnyActiveFocus both still answered true in the same call, right
			// after Unfocus returned. In all six the next poll saw HasFocus false
			// and HasAnyActiveFocus false, 49 to 73 ms later. So the unfocus is
			// deferred, it lands within one poll interval, and the mirror
			// converges - it never went on claiming a focus that had left.
			//
			// What that window means for the code: inside those tens of
			// milliseconds a read of HasFocus is stale true. SetFocus in that
			// window answers true without focusing, and the poll then reports
			// the loss; ClearFocus or the chord in that window send a second
			// Unfocus, which changes nothing a player can see. Both converge.
			//
			// THE FLAGS: pauseGame false and disableFocusMenu false. Not pausing
			// is what the Meridian backend does through this same bridge - a panel
			// is an overlay, and the coordinator's automatic release keys on menus
			// that pause. The focus menu stays enabled because it is what gives
			// the player a cursor; the four-way matrix changed nothing about the
