// for the contract and the design decisions.
//
// This SUPERSEDES the Part 1.5 trace, which hooked eight effect
// vtables plus nine functions on the caster and wrote nothing. Its job was to
// find where the engine applies each quantity, and every rule below comes from a
// specific measurement it produced rather than from reading the headers. What
// the trace measured, comparing a low attribute value against a high one in
// game:
//
//   [AdjustForPerks] 'Flames'          mag  8.0000 -> 11.0872  dur 1.1 -> 1.5245
//   [AdjustForPerks] 'Restore Health'  mag 10.0000 -> 13.8590  dur 1.0 -> 1.3859
//   [AdjustForPerks] 'Restore Stamina' mag 10.0000 -> 13.8590  dur 1.0 -> 1.3859
//   [CalculateCost]  'Flames'          13.0255 -> 10.0140
//   [CalculateCost]  'Healing'         11.0995 ->  8.5333
//
// Two facts drove the design. The magnitude factor (1.3859) and the cost factor
// (0.7688) are not related to each other, so the three channels have to be
// independently registerable. And the same 1.3859 landed on two different spells
// and three different effects, which is what makes a single multiplier per
// channel the right shape rather than something per-spell.
//
// CONFIRMED END TO END on 2026-07-20, with a live consumer driving all three
// channels and no third-party attribute plugin anywhere in the path. Firebolt,
// player attribute 0 against 85, read off the effect application site rather
// than off a tooltip:
//
//   magnitude  25.0000 -> 34.6475   (1.3859, exact)
//   Flames sustained damage, per-tick mean over 179 and 137 ticks:
//              8.012/s -> 11.096/s  (1.3849 measured against 1.3859 expected)
//   cost       36.4947 -> 28.0571   (0.7688, exact)
//
// The Part 1.5 magnitude figures above are therefore sound, not an artifact of
// the attribute plugin that was active when they were taken - a suspicion that
// was raised and is now settled by measurement.
//
// HOW THIS WAS ALMOST MISSED, because the same trap is still there. Magnitude
// was reported broken on the strength of floating combat damage numbers. Flames
// applies about 0.136 per 17ms tick, and 0.189 once scaled; both render as "1".
// A health-delta test did not settle it either, because timing a cast by hand
// carried an error the same size as the effect. What settled it was summing the
// per-tick values out of this module's own log, which is timestamped. When a
// test shows no difference, check first that it could have shown one.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO: the spell menu. Magnitude and duration in the
// tooltip do not move, and that is a consequence of the seam, NOT a vanilla UI
// limitation - measured 2026-07-20 with a vanilla perk:
//
//   no perk               description "25 points"
//   Augmented Flames on   description "31 points"   (25 * 1.25)
//
// So the description does consult perk entry points. AdjustForPerks runs when an
// active effect is instantiated on a target, which the menu never does, so
// nothing written there can reach it. Cost shows in the menu only because
// CalculateCost happens to be a function the menu calls; there is no
// CalculateMagnitude to match it, and that asymmetry is the entire reason two
// channels display and one does not.
//
// FIXED 2026-07-21 by moving magnitude to Actor::ForEachPerkEntry (vfunc 0x100),
// where the engine asks an actor which perk entries answer for an entry point -
// a question the spell menu asks too, and re-asks on every open. Magnitude is
// contributed there as a synthetic perk entry the actor does not hold, which is
// the technique Perk Entry Point Extender uses in production.
//
// Measured with the consumer driving the channel, attribute 0 against 85:
//
//   Firebolt        tooltip 25 -> 34    mag 25.0000 -> 34.6475
//   Lightning Bolt  tooltip 40 -> 55    mag 40.0000 -> 55.4360
//   Healing         tooltip 10 -> 13    mag 10.0000 -> 13.8590
//
// and, in the same save, NOT applying where it must not:
//
//   Crossbow of Burning   10 -> 10   (13 before the scope filter existed)
//   Potion of Healing     50 -> 50
//   Green Apple            2 ->  2
//
// TWO THINGS THAT COST A CRASH AND FIVE ATTEMPTS, so they are written down:
//
//   A synthetic entry cannot pass on its own. Zero condition tabs does not mean
//   "always passes" - it means no tab matched, which the engine treats as
//   failure. CheckConditionFilters (vfunc 0x00) is hooked and answers for this
//   one entry by pointer identity; everything else tail-calls the original.
//
//   entryData.numArgs is NOT an argument count. It is the perk condition tab
//   count - the third byte of DATA in the PERK record - and it must agree with
//   the conditions array. Declaring 3 tabs with a null array walked the engine
//   off the end of it: access violation inside condition evaluation. There is a
//   guard that refuses to install when the two disagree.
//
// REJECTED TARGETS, all ruled out by measurement rather than by argument:
//   SpellItem::AdjustCost (vfunc 0x63) - never runs on the player's cast path.
//     It fired for exactly one modded spell across every session.
//   Seven MagicCaster virtuals (0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x09, 0x10, 0x11) - all
//     report currentSpellCost already final. The caster never computes it.
//   BGSEntryPoint::HandleEntryPoint - the address is a function ID, so it needs
//     an inline hook, and its signature is variadic. CalculateCost gives the
//     same number with a signature that is written down in the headers.
//     NOTE: this rejection is about COST only. It does not carry over to the
//     tooltip problem described below, where the answer turned out to be
//     Actor::ForEachPerkEntry - a plain virtual, so a vtable swap, with no
//     variadic argument to forward.
//
// AdjustForPerks was itself wrongly dismissed on the first pass, and the reason
// is worth keeping: the runs that missed it cast at nothing (a concentration
// spell creates no effect without a target) and cast at an attribute value whose
// multiplier was 1. Neither run could have shown a change. The hook was right
// from the start; the test was not exercising it.
//
// EXCEPTION SAFETY: a C++ exception escaping a hook into the engine is undefined
// behavior. Every thunk wraps its body and calls the original exactly once.

		// Actor::ForEachPerkEntry (vfunc 0x100) is where the engine asks an actor

		// opening the spell menu queries kModSpellMagnitude and kModSpellDuration
		// there, interleaved with this module's own CalculateCost lines, and
		// re-queries on every open. Contributing an entry the actor does not hold
		// as a real perk is what makes the number move in both places at once.
		//
		// E1 PROVES ONE THING AND CHANGES NOTHING ELSE. The multiplier below is a
		// constant, not the channel, and AdjustForPerks still does the real
		// scaling exactly as before. If the tooltip shows the constant AND the
		// damage follows it, construction and composition are sound and E2 can
		// wire the channel in. If it does not, nothing that works today broke.
		//
		// THE ENTRY IS BUILT, NOT SUBCLASSED. The storage is ours and the vtable
		// pointers are the engine's, so the engine's own implementations run
		// against our fields. Deriving in C++ would mean emitting a vtable for
		// every virtual in BGSPerkEntry, and any one of them getting subtly
		// different behavior from the engine's is a difference that would not
		// show up until it mattered. Layouts are declared in the headers, so this
		// is construction rather than guesswork:
		//

		//                            functionData @18, conditions @20, perk @28
