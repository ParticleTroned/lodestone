# Lodestone

**A shared SKSE framework for Skyrim SE mods.**

Lodestone provides low-level native infrastructure to Skyrim mods that would otherwise each ship their own DLL: engine hooks a mod can drive from Papyrus at runtime, and a version gate. It is a dependency, not a gameplay mod.

Installed on its own it does nothing - every module is passthrough until a consumer registers something with it.

It is built on [CommonLibSSE-NG](https://github.com/alandtse/CommonLibVR/tree/ng), so a single DLL covers Skyrim SE, AE and VR.

---

## Status

Lodestone was extracted from the Intelligence Matters SKSE plugin, which is its first consumer. As of this release, Intelligence Matters has completed its migration and drives all four gameplay modules directly (Cast Time, Book Framework, Spell Tomes, Magic Scaling). Every channel has been validated end to end in game, including reload behavior for the session-scoped ones. The API is small and will keep growing as more consumers arrive; the versioning contract below exists for that reason.

**1.9.0 makes every channel multi-contributor.** Until 1.8.2 a channel had one owner: the first mod to register won it for the session, and a second mod registering a different pair of globals was warned in the log and refused. That is fine while one mod uses a channel and fails the moment two do - the loser dies quietly and its author gets a bug report with no visible cause. From 1.9.0 every registrant contributes and the DLL composes them (multipliers by product, offsets by sum). **Existing consumers need to change nothing**: no signature moved, and while a mod is the only registrant the numbers it gets are the same ones it got before. See [Channels and composition](#channels-and-composition).

Currently implemented. Every module is Core - it never knows a consumer by name. The Domain layer described in CONVENTIONS exists but is currently empty.

| Module | Since | Papyrus surface |
| ------ | ----- | --------------- |
| PluginInfo | 1.0.0 | `GetVersion()`, `GetVersionString()` |
| CastTime | 1.1.0 (multi-contributor since 1.9.0) | `RegisterCastTimeChannel()` |
| BookFramework | 1.2.0 | `SetBookText()`, `AppendBookText()`, `ClearBookText()`, `GetBookText()` |
| SpellTomes | 1.3.0 (behavior changed in 1.5.0; alias registration added in 1.6.0; suppression gated on registration in 1.8.0) | `RegisterForSpellTomeRead()`, `UnregisterForSpellTomeRead()`, `RegisterForSpellTomeReadAlias()`, `UnregisterForSpellTomeReadAlias()`, `ConsumeSpellTome()`, event `OnSpellTomeRead` |
| MagicScaling | 1.4.0 (magnitude moved to the perk entry seam in 1.7.0 - now shows in the spell menu, and no longer touches enchantments, food or potions; multi-contributor since 1.9.0; scope narrowed in 1.28.0) | `RegisterMagicMagnitudeChannel()`, `RegisterMagicDurationChannel()`, `RegisterMagicCostChannel()` - **scope narrowed in 1.28.0:** a spell is in scope only when its type is Spell and its costliest effect has a magic school, so the invisible helper spells a mod casts from a script (a buff, a marker, a cooldown timer) are left alone. The registration functions themselves did not change and are still `>= 1004000`; gate on `>= 1028000` to count on the exclusion |
| EffectDescription | 1.24.0 (writing added in 1.29.0) | `GetEffectDescription()` - a MagicEffect's description text, raw: `<mag>` and `<dur>` are left for the caller to substitute, and `""` is an ordinary answer (no text, or only whitespace). `SetEffectDescription()`, `ClearEffectDescription()` - queue a write or a restore-to-original; the `Bool` means "queued", not "written", and writing an effect read from a plugin changes it for the whole load order until the next load. No hook, no cosave; session-scoped state (the pre-write original, kept to undo it) |
| SpellRead | 1.25.0 | `GetSpellSchools()`, `GetSpellSkillLevels()`, `GetSpellNames()` - batch readers: a `Spell[]` in, a parallel array out, one call for the whole array instead of one per spell. School and level come from the costliest effect. Read-only; no hook, no state |
| MenuPrompt | 1.26.0 | `MenuPromptAvailable()`, `MenuPromptBusy()`, `MenuPromptList()`, `MenuPromptText()`, `MenuPromptTakeText()` - asks the player a question on screen and hands the answer back: pick one of N texts, or type a line. **The two prompts wait**: the calling script stops until the player answers, like the menus they replace, and the game is paused while one is open. Three outcomes are kept apart - an answer (`0` and up), a cancellation (`-1`: Escape, Cancel, or a load taking the prompt away) and a refusal (`-2`: nothing was shown) - and an empty line is an answer, which is why text comes back as a ticket for `MenuPromptTakeText()` rather than as a String. One prompt at a time across the load order; a second request is refused, not queued. No entry ceiling in this surface; lists are drawn through a clipper. Needs [SKSE Menu Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120352) installed, and the module is inert and silent without it. **It is not a dependency of Lodestone:** it is detected at runtime, `MenuPromptAvailable()` answers `False` without it, and nothing is written to the log. A consumer that builds a flow on these prompts inherits that framework's requirements, not Lodestone. Gate on `>= 1026000` |
| Detection | 1.9.0 | `RegisterDetectionMultiplierChannel()` |
| DetectionRead | 1.14.0 (keyword filtering added in 1.15.0; candidate and scale corrections in 1.15.1) | `GetHighestDetectionLevel()`, `GetDetectionObserverCount()`, `GetHighestDetectionLevelExcluding()`, `GetDetectionObserverCountExcluding()` |
| ChannelInfo | 1.9.0 | `GetChannelContributorCount()`, `GetChannelContributorPlugin()` |
| EquipVeto | 1.16.0 | `BlockEquip()`, `UnblockEquip()`, `ClearEquipBlocks()`, `IsEquipBlocked()`, `GetEquipBlockCount()` |
| Incapacitation | 1.10.0 (usable from 1.11.0 - see below) | `KnockoutActor()`, `WakeActor()`, `KnockoutFall()`, `KnockoutRecover()`, `IsManagedUnconscious()`, `GetActorLifeState()`, `RegisterForActorWoke()`, `UnregisterForActorWoke()`, `RegisterForActorWokeAlias()`, `UnregisterForActorWokeAlias()`, event `OnActorWoke` |
| WebUIBridge | 1.17.0 (as PrismaBridge; renamed in 1.18.0, when the surface stopped naming one supplier) | `WebUIAvailable()`, `WebUICreateView()`, `WebUIIsViewReady()`, `WebUICall()`, `WebUIShow()`, `WebUIHide()`, `WebUIIsViewVisible()`, `WebUIDestroyView()`, `WebUIRegisterListener()`, `WebUIGetBackend()`, `WebUIHasCapability()`, `WebUIGetViewState()`, `WebUIGetListenerSlotsFree()`, `WebUIFocusView()`, `WebUIClearFocus()`, `WebUIIsViewFocused()`, event `LodestoneWebUIViewReady`. The nine 1.17.x `Prisma*` names still answer, and so does the event `LodestonePrismaViewReady` - both are sent from the same point, and the old names go away in 2.0.0. The three focus functions arrived in **DLL** 1.22.0 and are gated by capability rather than by version alone: ask `WebUIHasCapability("view-focus")`, which is `True` on both backends since **DLL** 1.27.0 - Prisma UI answered `False` from 1.22.0 to 1.26.x, until Lodestone gave it a panic chord of its own, which on that backend only releases focus, only for views of this bridge, and does not stop the keypress reaching the page. Do **not** read `"focus-stack"` as that question - it asks whether two views can hold focus independently, answers `False` on both backends, and stays that way. Needs a web UI backend installed - either [Meridian UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/190723) or [Prisma UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148718), supported since **DLL** 1.21.0 and 1.17.0 respectively - those are this plugin's versions, not the backends' - and the module is inert and silent without either. **Neither is a dependency:** both are detected at runtime, one is used per session, and with neither installed every function above returns its sentinel and nothing is written to the log. Which one is in use is `WebUIGetBackend()`, and `WebUIBackend` in `Lodestone.ini` chooses when both are installed. **Packaging roots are NOT symmetric, since DLL 1.23.0:** `Data\PrismaUI\views\<asViewPath>` is shared by every consumer, while `Data\MeridianUI\<asViewPath>` gives each consumer its own top-level folder - Meridian UI isolates mods by host and its traversal guard refuses a file that does not resolve inside the host's own real folder, so two mods under one shared host cannot both work. The Meridian root lost an intermediate `Lodestone\` level in 1.23.0; gate on `>= 1023000` and move the folder up one |

**Detection is a channel with no hook behind it yet**, and that is deliberate rather than unfinished. It scales a detection value you compute yourself, with the same shape as the magic scaling channels. Nothing applies the composed pair to the engine's own detection calculation, and after the investigation described below, nothing is going to: a consumer that wants to suppress or scale detection is better served by an existing, widely installed dependency than by this framework reimplementing it. The channel remains useful for what it always did - letting two mods compose a detection value they compute themselves instead of one of them silently losing.

**DetectionRead is a separate module, and it only reads.** Added in 1.14.0, it reports the detection score the engine already keeps: the highest level any actor currently has against a given actor, plus a count. 1.15.0 added a filtered pair that excludes observers carrying a keyword - "is a humanoid watching me", ignoring wildlife - by building its own aggregate rather than using the engine's. Three things are worth knowing before you use it, and all three are documented at length in `Lodestone.psc`:

- **The scale is signed, and it jumps.** Zero is the detected boundary; below it there is a floor around -1000 while nobody is paying attention, and the value moves straight to roughly -20 the moment someone notices, with nothing observed in between. Do not interpolate across it or size a threshold at the midpoint of an assumed band - branch on it. Versions 1.14.0 and 1.15.0 documented a "-100 to 0" band that was wrong, and a consumer sized a threshold against it before this was caught.
- **The level and the count are two samples, not one atomic reading.** Each is self-consistent within a single call, but you read them as two calls and the DLL's refresh can land between them. Branch on one of the two rather than requiring them to agree.
- **The filtered pair's aggregate is not the engine's**, so it is not promised to match the unfiltered pair even with no keyword excluded.

**Incapacitation ships as WORK IN PROGRESS, and the label is literal.** Every other module here is driven in play by a consumer that uses it; this one is not. The mod it was built for is in suspended development, so nothing calls it today. The code is complete and the hooks install and report themselves in the log, but "no consumer has exercised this" and "this works" are different claims and only the first is verified. The specific gap: the knockout registry is serialized to the cosave and read back on load, and that round trip has never run with a non-empty registry - only `KnockoutActor()` fills it, and nothing outside development has called it. Everything below is accurate about what the code does; none of it is a claim that it has been proven in play.

**Incapacitation is a managed non-lethal knockout.** Applying and reverting the state is mostly calls the engine already exposes publicly (`SetLifeState`, `EvaluatePackage`, and a few interrupts). It has no native timer: how long a knockout lasts is a balance decision, so the consumer runs its own Papyrus timer and calls `WakeActor()` when it decides the knockout ends - the same call also serves a forced wake. `IsManagedUnconscious()` answers from Lodestone's own registry rather than the engine's `IsUnconscious()`, so it distinguishes a knockout this module caused from vanilla stun causes that never touch the same life state. The registry survives a save or reload, and a managed actor that dies is dropped from it automatically, so `IsManagedUnconscious()` returns false for a corpse.

**The physical fall is separate from the knockout, and that split is the design rather than an accident.** The module's job is to make an actor unconscious; whether the body also goes to the ground is the consumer's call. `KnockoutFall()` and `KnockoutRecover()` are the two optional calls for it, and a consumer that uses neither gets exactly the knockout it always got.

**The fall needs `Actor.SetUnconscious()` alongside it, and the order is part of the contract:**

```papyrus
Lodestone.KnockoutFall(akTarget)     ; registers the actor
akTarget.SetUnconscious(True)        ; the fall is applied in here

akTarget.SetUnconscious(False)       ; the release is applied in here
Lodestone.KnockoutRecover(akTarget)  ; then clean up
```

The reason is where the work has to happen. Applying the state from a Papyrus call does not hold: a Papyrus call lands between engine frames, and the state machine settles before the next one runs. It holds when applied from inside the engine's own unconscious handler, which nothing can enter except by something calling `Actor.SetUnconscious` - a native that exists in Papyrus and has no C++ equivalent. So Lodestone hooks that function and does the work there, for actors `KnockoutFall()` registered and no others. Register an actor after the call instead of before and the hook sees an actor it does not know; recover before releasing and the registration is already gone. `Lodestone.psc` states both orderings at the calls.

**Nothing happens to actors you did not register.** Installing Lodestone next to a mod that calls `SetUnconscious` leaves that mod behaving exactly as it did - the same passthrough rule every other module here follows.

**The fall is not available in VR.** Its Address Library ids are known for SE and AE only, and the two-argument `REL::RelocationID` constructor silently reuses the SE id against VR's separate numbering, so the hook is not installed there and the log says so. The knockout itself works on all three.

**Gate the fall on 1013002.** The two functions exist from 1.12.0, but nothing they did held the actor down until 1.13.2. The knockout gate below is unchanged.

**Gate Incapacitation on 1.11.0, not 1.10.0.** The functions exist in 1.10.0, but `KnockoutActor()` refused every actor there: it read the life state through the C++ base-class hierarchy, which in a multi-runtime build does not point at the running game's layout, so it saw the same constant for every actor. 1.11.0 reads it through `AsActorState()` and adds `GetActorLifeState()`, which reports the number a consumer would otherwise have to infer from a refusal. The trap and how to avoid it are written up in `CONVENTIONS.md`.

All functions are global natives on the `Lodestone` script, so they are called as `Lodestone.GetVersion()`. Full signatures and per-function notes are in `Lodestone.psc`, which is the authoritative reference - a consumer copies that file into its own scripts.

**Spell tomes follow the same contract as everything else since 1.8.0.** With no consumer registered, the module is pure passthrough: tomes teach their spell and are eaten exactly as in vanilla. Once a consumer registers for `OnSpellTomeRead`, reading a spell tome does nothing on its own: the spell is not taught and the book is not consumed. The book is flagged as read, since the player did open it, and that is all. The consumer then decides everything: it teaches with plain Papyrus `AddSpell` when its own system says the spell is earned, and eats the book with `ConsumeSpellTome()` if and when it should be spent. Calling both immediately in the handler reproduces vanilla exactly.

Registration order matters, as with every channel: register before the first tome read you want intercepted, and re-register on every game load. A tome read before the registration lands is vanilla - spell learned, book consumed - and is not reverted afterwards.

(From 1.5.0 to 1.7.0 the suppression was unconditional - installing the DLL alone stopped every spell tome from working. That was retired in 1.8.0: it broke vanilla tomes for anyone whose load order carries Lodestone as a mere dependency, and collided with other mods on the same seam. A consumer that relied on it must register, gated on `GetVersion() >= 1008000`.)

> **Changed in 1.5.0.** Through 1.4.0 the module kept the book but still let the spell be learned on read. A consumer written against that behavior must now teach the spell itself; gate on `Lodestone.GetVersion() >= 1005000`.

## Using Lodestone from Papyrus

The Lodestone was not designed to be bundled in consumer mods, but you can do so. It ships as its own download, and consumers list it as a requirement. Please note, two mods bundling different versions of the same DLL means the Mod Organizer overwrite order silently decides which one wins, and the loser breaks with no legible symptom. Therefore, it is advisable to reference it, though it is not mandatory.

### The version gate

Every consumer declares a minimum Lodestone version and checks it at startup.

```papyrus
Int Function MinimumLodestoneVersion() global
    Return 1000000  ; 1.0.0
EndFunction

Function CheckLodestone()
    Int found = Lodestone.GetVersion()
    If found < MinimumLodestoneVersion()
        ; Fail loudly. Do not continue, do not log quietly to the Papyrus log.
        Debug.MessageBox("MyMod requires Lodestone " + ... + " or newer.")
        Return
    EndIf
EndFunction
```

`GetVersion()` returns the version packed as `major * 1000000 + minor * 1000 + patch`, so `1.0.0` is `1000000`.

If the DLL is missing or failed to load, the native call fails at the VM level and Papyrus yields `0`, which is below any real version. A single `>=` check therefore covers both "absent" and "too old". Do not parse `GetVersionString()` for gating - it exists for display and logs.

### Channels and composition

Most of what Lodestone does is exposed as a **channel**: you own two `GlobalVariable` records - a multiplier and an offset - drive them from your own Papyrus, and hand them to the DLL once at startup and after every load. The DLL then applies them where the engine has finished computing the quantity:

```
value = (value * multiplier) + offset
```

A multiplier of `1.0` with an offset of `0.0` is a no-op, so a channel can be neutralised without unregistering it. A channel nobody has registered is pure passthrough.

Since **1.9.0** a channel takes any number of contributors, identified by the plugin the multiplier global came from. They compose:

```
multiplier total = the product of every registered multiplier
offset total     = the sum of every registered offset
result           = (value * multiplier total) + offset total
```

Applied once, not once per contributor. Registering the same pair again from the same plugin is an idempotent refresh, so re-registering on every game load costs nothing and does not double anything.

Three consequences worth stating plainly:

- **Nothing is refused.** `Register...Channel` returns `True` when *your* pair is contributing, which now includes the case where other mods are contributing too. It returns `False` only on a `None` argument.
- **While you are alone, nothing changed.** One contributor makes the totals `1.0 * multiplier` and `0.0 + offset`, which are exact in floating point. A consumer written against the single-owner versions computes the same numbers on 1.9.0.
- **You cannot see the others from your own maths, only from the diagnostics.** `GetChannelContributorCount()` and `GetChannelContributorPlugin()` report how many plugins drive a channel and which ones, for an MCM or a debug command. They are read-only on purpose: no consumer can outrank or evict another. Which mod wins is not a question this framework answers - all of them do, by composition.

Balance stays where it always was. How much *you* ask for is your Papyrus's decision; how several requests combine is the DLL's, because the DLL is the only thing that can see more than one of them.

### Versioning contract

Once two mods depend on the same DLL, a user running one of them updated and the other outdated is guaranteed, not hypothetical. So:

1. **The Papyrus API only grows.** Signatures never change. A function that turns out to be wrong gets deprecated, not corrected in place.
2. **Behavior never changes silently.** No balance tuning lives in this DLL.
3. **The DLL version is independent of any mod version on Nexus.** It is bumped when the native API or native behavior changes.

---

## For mod authors: what Lodestone is not

> **The framework provides capability. Papyrus decides policy.**

No balance value lives here. Lodestone exposes hooks, actor values and channels; what to do with them is the consumer's Papyrus. If a feature only makes sense for one mod's design, it does not belong in Core.

### Core and Domain

Modules live in one of two layers, and the distinction is enforced, not aspirational:

| Layer | Rule |
| ----- | ---- |
| **Core** (`Lodestone::Core`) | **Never** knows a consumer by name. PluginInfo, Log, the Papyrus dispatcher, actor values, localization, ExtraData. |
| **Domain** (`Lodestone::Modules`) | **May** hardcode its own consumer's plugin file. Gated on that file's presence, passthrough when absent. |

No Domain module ships yet. A Domain module may gate on its own consumer's plugin file - present, it does its work; absent, it stays passthrough - a bounded, deliberate exception that never leaks into Core. `CastTime` began that way and moved to Core once its consumer coupling was replaced by runtime registration (`RegisterCastTimeChannel`): a Core module never knows a consumer by name, and takes what it needs at runtime instead.

### Native API conventions

- A native never lets a C++ exception cross into the Papyrus VM. Escaping into the VM is undefined behavior and can take the game down. Fallible natives wrap their body and return a sentinel.
- Errors are reported by return value, never by throwing: `Int -> -1`, `String -> ""`, `Bool -> false`. The sentinel is documented per function in the `.psc`, which is the contract Papyrus reads.
- The same applies to hooks. Nothing this plugin installs may throw across an engine boundary.

## Building

Requirements:

- Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ toolset (C++23)
- CMake 3.21+
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), with `VCPKG_ROOT` set

CommonLibSSE-NG comes from a git submodule pinned to a release tag; vcpkg covers the transitive dependencies. On a fresh clone, initialize the submodules first:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The WebUI bridge compiles against the API headers of both backends it supports, and the two are handled differently for a licensing reason rather than a preference:

- `extern/meridianui-api/` **is in the repository.** Meridian UI's API headers are plain MIT, which adds no restriction, so they are vendored here with their `LICENSE-MIT` alongside. Nothing to do.
- `extern/prismaui-api/PrismaUI_API.h` **is not**, and has to be copied in by hand. The Prisma UI API header by StarkMP is under the Prisma UI License, which is proprietary and source-available and adds restrictions this GPL-3.0-only repository cannot carry. The README in that folder says where to get it.

Neither backend has to be installed to build, and neither ships with the DLL - both are compile-time interfaces, detected at runtime.

The menu prompt module compiles against one more third-party header, and it is kept out for a different reason again:

- `extern/skse-menu-framework/SKSEMenuFramework.h` **is not in the repository**, and has to be copied in by hand. Its license is LGPL-2.1, which this repository could carry; it stays out because it is a single large file its author distributes separately and revises on their own schedule, so vendoring it would fork it. The README in that folder says where to get it, which copy this build used, and how it was checked against the installed framework.

The same rule applies: SKSE Menu Framework does not have to be installed to build, and does not ship with the DLL.

```
cmake --preset <preset>
cmake --build build --config Release
```

To have the build copy the DLL straight into a mod folder, set `LODESTONE_OUTPUT_FOLDER` - do not edit the default in `CMakeLists.txt`:

```
cmake --preset <preset> -DLODESTONE_OUTPUT_FOLDER="C:/path/to/mods/Lodestone/SKSE/Plugins"
```

The plugin writes to `Documents/My Games/Skyrim Special Edition/SKSE/Lodestone.log`. Release builds log at `info`; debug builds log everything.

## Contributing

Read `CONVENTIONS.md` first. Its top half is a core shared with the author's other C++/SKSE projects and is not edited in this repository; the `Project appendix` at the bottom is this project's own - the layer split, the log file, and the framework policy that governs the Papyrus API.

The one thing worth knowing up front: this codebase documents *why*, with evidence. Hook targets, rejected alternatives and non-obvious engine behavior are explained inline, citing the trace that established them. A change that alters behavior is expected to say what it observed, not what it assumed.
